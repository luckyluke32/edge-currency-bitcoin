### BREAKING CHANGES

- Stop supporting receiving the wallet format as type of the wallet type.
  For example, `wallet:bitcoin-bip44` is not supported anymore.
  The CORRECT way to pass in the wallet format is inside the keys object which is in the walletInfo.
  Example:

  ```js
  walletInfo = {
    keys: {
      seed: "whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever",
      format: "bip49"
    }
  };
  ```

- Split each currency Info into 3 different config objects depends on the where and how they are going to be used:

  1. bcoinInfo - The data needed to extend Bcoin into supporting the currency
  2. engineInfo - The hard coded data needed to configure the engine for the currency
  3. currencyInfo - The original EdgeCurrencyInfo needed to be passed on to core/gui according to the API specs - This got ALOT cleaner

  Also typed everything so no more using `defaultSettings` which was typed as Any as a garbage hole where we stuffed everything we didn't know where to put.
  Everything is now strongly typed so keep it like that.

### New Features

- `getSplittableTypes` API to the plugin.
- bip84 wallet type as default to the networks that supports it.
- Settings and factories for `BitcoinGold` and `BitcoinGoldTestnet`.

### Fix

- Two Way Replay Protection scheme.
- `sweepPrivateKey` only signed with a key corresponding to the wallet type. Now we try all possible combinations.

## 2.22.0

- Full support for the SIGHASH_FORKID two-way replay protection scheme (For forks like bcash and bgold)
- Full support for bip84 wallets.
- Removed all of the \$FlowFixMe (except for the one for 'buffer-hack') from the code.
